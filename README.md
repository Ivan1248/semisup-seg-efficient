# semisup-seg-efficient
Code for reproducing results from "[A baseline for semi-supervised learning of efficient semantic segmentation models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07075)".

## Work in progress
[This repository](https://github.com/Ivan1248/Vidlu) contains (among other things) the code necessary for reproducing the experiments. I am working on making things more approachable.

Scripts for reproducing the results in the paper are [here](https://github.com/Ivan1248/Vidlu/tree/master/scripts/papers/semisup_efficient_mva21).
